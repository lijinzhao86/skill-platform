 * (see {@link SkillSearchService}), so what M8 needs is M7's catalog seam, not a database.
 *
 * <p>{@link RelevanceWeights} arrives as a bean rather than being read from configuration here,
 * because a module's wiring may not depend on {@code config}. See {@code RankingConfig}, which
 * builds it. The record validates itself, so a nonsensical configuration fails at startup rather
 * than quietly reordering everyone's results.
