 * <p>Called explicitly by each use case rather than by an interceptor, and that choice is the
 * point: §3.5's list — publish, delete, rollback, token issue and revoke — is exactly the set of
 * actions that already have a transaction boundary, and an audit row written inside the same
 * transaction as the change it describes cannot disagree with it. An interceptor placed above the
 * use case would have neither the business vocabulary for {@code detail} nor a reliable answer to
 * "did the change actually commit".
