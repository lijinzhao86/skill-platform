/**
 * Turns caller text into a {@code LIKE} pattern that matches it literally.
 *
 * <p>Without this, a query of {@code %} matches every skill and {@code _} matches any single
 * character — the caller's text would be read as a pattern language rather than as text. That is a
 * correctness bug, not an injection: the value still travels as a bound parameter, so nothing can
 * escape the string. It is the <em>meaning</em> of the characters that has to be pinned down.
 *
 * <p>It lives beside the SQL that consumes it rather than beside the code that decides what to
 * search for. The pattern and the {@code ESCAPE} clause are one idea in two places, and a module
 * boundary between them is a chance for them to disagree — which nothing would notice, because a
 * wrong escape produces plausible results rather than an error.
