/**
 * Wires M5. It has no hidden implementation to protect — the validator is a plain public type —
 * but the wiring still lives here rather than in {@code internal} so that every module assembles
 * itself the same way, and so that adding a hidden implementation later does not force the
 * wiring to move.
 *
 * <p>The limits are the standard's, not a deployment setting. They are deliberately not
 * configurable: a server that accepted more than 512 files or 16 MiB would store skills that the
 * clients enforcing those same numbers will refuse to load, and a configurable ceiling is an
 * invitation for the two sides to disagree. Tests pass their own {@link IngestLimits} instead.
