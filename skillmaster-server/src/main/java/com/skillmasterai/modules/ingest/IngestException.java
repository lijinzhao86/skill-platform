 * The upload is not acceptable. Carries every problem found, not just the first, so a caller

 *
 * <p>Never thrown for something that was merely unexpected — only for input that genuinely fails
 * a stated rule. If the validator cannot decide, it must not guess: §3.3 requires no silent
 * degradation, and silently dropping a file or a field is exactly what the archived baseline did.
