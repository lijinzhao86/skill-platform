/**
 * The error body every 4xx and 5xx carries:
 * {@code {"error": {"code": ..., "message": ..., "details": [...]}}}.
 *
 * <p>Wrapped in an {@code error} object rather than spread across the top level so that a
 * successful response and an error response can never be confused for one another, and so a
 * field can be added to the envelope later without colliding with anything.
 *
 * <p>This is our own shape, not RFC 9457 {@code problem+json}. The design doc fixes only the
 * {@code WWW-Authenticate} headers for 401/403 (§4.1) and leaves the body open; keeping the body
 * to one shape across all statuses is worth more than matching a media type that nothing in the
 * client set consumes. Responses are served as {@code application/json}.
 *
 * @param code    stable, for clients to branch on
 * @param message human-readable, for logs and for whoever is debugging
 * @param details which field was wrong, when the error is about specific input
