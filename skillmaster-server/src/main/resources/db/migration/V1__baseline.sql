-- Baseline schema for v1-hosting: every table of technical-design.md ch.3.
--
-- Built in one migration rather than one per module because skill.created_by references
-- app_user, so the identity tables have to exist anyway; splitting them would only mean
-- churning the baseline again in P1.
--
-- Two deliberate divergences from the design doc, each explained where it appears:
--   1. `audit_event.id` is GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (ADR 0010 decision, doc updated).
--   2. No TABLESPACE clause (below).
--
-- No extensions are required. The Chinese-search index (pg_bigm) is deliberately absent:
-- P0 queries L1 with LIKE, and pg_bigm is a pure index that can be added later without
-- changing a single query. That keeps P0 runnable on a stock PostgreSQL.
--
-- Every table and column carries a COMMENT, and those comments are the only place a column's
-- meaning is written down here — the annotations that used to sit beside each column were moved
-- into them rather than copied, because one description living in two places is a description
-- that drifts. The prose blocks above each table are a different kind of statement: they say why
-- the table exists, which is not what a COMMENT is for. Read them with `psql \d+ <table>`.
